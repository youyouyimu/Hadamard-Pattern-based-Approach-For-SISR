The modcrop function and compute_psnr function are from the source code of:
C. Dong, C. C. Loy, K. He, and X. Tang. Learning a
deep convolutional network for image super-resolution. In
European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 184¨C199.
Springer, 2014.



The learned mapping function as well as the decision trees for scaling factor 2, 3 and 4 can be directly used for SR tests.
